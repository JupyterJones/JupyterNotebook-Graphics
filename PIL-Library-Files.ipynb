    "# ImageDraw Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The ImageDraw module provide simple 2D graphics for Image objects. \n",
    "You can use this module to create new images, annotate or retouch existing images, \n",
    "and to generate graphics on the fly for web use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more advanced drawing library for PIL, see the aggdraw module.\n",
    "Example: Draw a gray cross over an image\n",
    "\n",
    "from PIL import Image, ImageDraw\n",
    "im = Image.open(\"lena.pgm\")\n",
    "\n",
    "draw = ImageDraw.Draw(im)\n",
    "draw.line((0, 0) + im.size, fill=128)\n",
    "draw.line((0, im.size[1], im.size[0], 0), fill=128)\n",
    "del draw\n",
    "\n",
    "# write to stdout\n",
    "im.save(sys.stdout, \"PNG\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Concepts\n",
    "Coordinates\n",
    "The graphics interface uses the same coordinate system as PIL itself, with (0, 0) in the upper left corner.\n",
    "Colors\n",
    "To specify colors, you can use numbers or tuples just as you would use with PIL.Image.Image.new() \n",
    "or PIL.Image.Image.putpixel(). For “1”, “L”, and “I” images, use integers. For “RGB” images, \n",
    "use a 3-tuple containing integer values. For “F” images, use integer or floating point values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For palette images (mode “P”), use integers as color indexes. In 1.1.4 and later, \n",
    "you can also use RGB 3-tuples or color names (see below). The drawing layer will automatically assign color indexes, \n",
    "as long as you don’t draw with more than 256 colors.\n",
    "Color Names\n",
    "See Color Names for the color names supported by Pillow.\n",
    "Fonts\n",
    "PIL can use bitmap fonts or OpenType/TrueType fonts.\n",
    "Bitmap fonts are stored in PIL’s own format, where each font typically consists of a two files, \n",
    "one named .pil and the other usually named .pbm. The former contains font metrics, the latter raster data.\n",
    "To load a bitmap font, use the load functions in the ImageFont module.\n",
    "To load a OpenType/TrueType font, use the truetype function in the ImageFont module. \n",
    "Note that this function depends on third-party libraries, and may not available in all PIL builds.\n",
    "Example: Draw Partial Opacity Text\n",
    "\n",
    "from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont\n",
    "# get an image\n",
